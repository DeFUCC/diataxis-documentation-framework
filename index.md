Diátaxis Framework
==================

**A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.**

The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in
technical documentation. It adopts a systematic approach to
understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of
interaction with a product.

Four modes of documentation
---------------------------

> ***Diátaxis***
>
> From the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς - *dia*, "across", and *taxis*,
> "arrangement".

The framework identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**,
**how-to guides**, **technical reference** and **explanation**.

Each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils
a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.

Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these
four types, and should keep them all separate and distinct from each
other.

In other words, what we call *documentation* is fundamentally not one
thing, but four. Understanding the implications of this, and how those
four different things work, can help improve most documentation.

Diátaxis promises to make documentation and projects better, and the
teams that work with them more successful.

Light-weight and easily adopted
-------------------------------

The framework is light-weight, easy to understand and straightforward to
apply. It doesn't impose implementation constraints.

Complete and comprehensive
--------------------------

Diátaxis provides a comprehensive and nearly universally-applicable
scheme, that has been proven in practice
across a wide variety of fields and applications \<adoption\>. These
include large and small, and open and proprietary documentation
projects.

encapsulated in Diátaxis, from PyCon Australia 2017.
