# Разработка Диатаксиса

Diátaxis was created and developed by Daniele Procida at
[Divio](https://divio.com).

Divio's [developer documentation](https://docs.divio.com) for its cloud
management/ application deployment platform is a high-quality example of
a complete Diátaxis implementation.

The Diátaxis framework continues to be developed and refined.
